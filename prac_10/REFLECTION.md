## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? 
In CP1401, I usually made many mistakes when doing the practical, however, I think can work better now.
Regular practice allows me to become more proficient in coding as I engage in problem-solving exercises, work on practicals.
I gain familiarity with different programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures.
With practice and learning from the mistake, I become more efficient at translating ideas into functional code,
writing clean and readable code, and more understanding programming languages.
## Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews? 
Lessons learned from being reviewed:

- Gain new perspectives: Code reviews provide an opportunity for me to receive useful feedback from other people. 
Reviews can offer some suggestions and alternative approaches to solving problems, helping 
me broaden my horizons and improve the quality of my code.
- Learn from mistakes: Code reviews can highlight my mistakes or areas of improvement in my code. It is an 
opportunity for me to learn from my errors and understand how to enhance my coding skills.

Lessons learned from doing reviews:

- Pay more attention to details: Reviewing my friend codes helps me become more meticulous in examining code logic, 
syntax, and potential issues. It trains me to spot errors, inconsistencies, and potential improvements in the code under review.
- Learn from others' code: I have an opportunity to learn from the code written by my friends. Therefore, I can 
gain insights into different coding styles, techniques, and approaches. Moreover, by reviewing others' code, I can 
expand your knowledge and discover new ways of solving problems.

Overall, participating in code reviews, both as a reviewer and being reviewed, provides valuable learning opportunities 
and improves overall code quality. I think it is an essential practice for fostering growth and maintaining 
high standards for a programmer. 
## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would design a variety of practical tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. Instead of focusing on isolated task, 
I would incorporate projects that require students to solve more complex problems, work on tasks which connect to 
real-world use cases. I think this approach would provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of 
how programming language is applied in practical contexts.

## My two (2) PRs that show me doing good code reviews in the past pracs:
- The link [review for Prac7](https://github.com/Dennis-THA/cp1404practicals/pull/3#discussion_r1429125195).
- The link [review for Prac5](https://github.com/CaoShaungLi/cp1404practicals/pull/1#discussion_r1419182121).
